    <h1><b>Creating your first video Setup</b></h1>
        <h2>Lighting and Monitoring your Camera</h2>
    
        <p>This is a tutorial for being able to record a self tape, useful for video auditions, interviews or conferences.</p>
    
        <h3>Step One - Lighting:</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Identify light sources present in the room, and dim/ turn them off</li>
            <li>grab your artificial lights (LEDs) and place:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>one 20-25 degrees in front of the subject (your front light)</li>
                    <li>one 20 - 25 degrees behind your subject (your back light)</li>
                    <li>one pointing at a white surface to add atmospheric light</li>
                </ul>
            <li><em>TIP: add a small colour source at 90 degrees to add some fun to your shot</em></li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>Step Two - Camera:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>After lighting, switch on your camera</li>
            <li>If your subject is too bright:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>turn up the ISO</li>
                </ul>
        <li>If your frame is flickering (black lines streak across the image):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Lower your shutter speed (NB, do not lower further than 1/50, due to the fact that cameras can record lower than that)</li>
                <li><em>TIP: keep your aperture all the way open for a dreamy look with a clear focus on the foreground and a blurred out background</em></li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step Three - Shooting and Editing:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Find a comfortable outfit/ look and shoot away</li>
            <li>If you are filming with audio:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>clap/ slate before each take to easily sync them in post</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Import your footage into an editing software such as DaVinci:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>choose your shots in the cut tab</li>
                <li>edit in the edit tab</li>
                <li>colour grade in the colour tab and audio edit in Fairlight</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Export your video accordingly, and get ready to share your smile! </li>
        </ol>
